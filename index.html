    <h1><a name="context">Scientific context</a></h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of the Pragmatics of SAT (PoS) workshop is to allow researchers concerned with the design of efficient SAT and CP
      solvers at large or SAT encodings/CP formulation to meet and discuss about their latest results. The workshop is also
      the place for users of SAT and CP technology to present their applications. The collocation of CP, ICLP and SAT this year is
      a unique opportunity to enlarge the audience of the workshop to the whole constraint community, thus the specific name ``Pragmatics
      of Constraint Reasoning".

      <h2>Background</h2>
      The success of SAT technology in the last decade is mainly due to both the availability of numerous efficient SAT solvers
      and to the growing number of problems that can efficiently be solved through a translation into SAT. There are also numerous
      CP systems available today, in various languages, some of them hybridizing CP and SAT. Designing efficient solvers requires
      both a good theoretical knowledge about the design of those solvers, i.e. how are interacting all its components, and
      a deep practical knowledge about how to implement efficiently such components. The CP community organizes regularly competitive
      events (SAT competition or SAT Races, QBF Evaluation, MAXSAT evaluation, Minizinc Challenge, etc.) to evaluate available
      solvers on a wide range of problems. The winners of those events set regularly new standards in the area. If the systems
      themselves are widely spread, many details on their design or in their implementation can only be found in the source
      code of the systems. The aim of the workshop is to allow researchers to share some gory technical details about their
      systems that they cannot usually share within the main SAT or CP conference.

      <h2>History</h2>
      The first workshops dedicated to the practical aspects of constraint programming were organized under the series TRICS: Techniques
      foR Implementing Constraint programming Systems. The workshops were organized in 2000 (Singapore), 2002 (Ithaca), 2010
      (St Andrews) and <a href"http://cp2013.a4cp.org/workshops/trics">2013 (Uppsala)</a>. The first edition of PoS took place during
      FLoC 2010. The second edition took place before SAT 2011, in Ann Arbor. The third edition took place on June 16, 2012,
      between the second SAT/SMT Summer School (June 12 to 15) and the SAT conference (June 17-20). The fourth edition took
      place on July 8, once again between the SAT/SMT summer school and the SAT conference. The fifth edition took place during
      the Vienna Summer of Logic, just before the SAT conference. The sixth edition took place before the SAT conference, in
      Austin. The last edition took place before the SAT conference, in Bordeaux.

	<h1><a name="registration">Registration</a></h1>

<p>There is no specific registration for PoCR. Registration for the workshops day is available on from one of the conference hosting conference (<a href="http://sat2017.gitlab.io/registration.html">SAT</a>, <a href="http://cp2017.a4cp.org/registration.html">CP</a>, <a href="http://iclp17.a4lp.org/registration.html">ICLP</a>) and allows to attend any workshop that day.</p>
<h1><a name="submission">Submission</a></h1>
<p>
  The workshop welcomes three categories of papers:
  <ul>
    <li><span class="label label-default">Regular papers</span> describing original work on a topic of the workshop, whose focus
      is too narrow to be published in a conference.</li>
    <li><span class="label label-default">Work in progress papers</span> describing less mature work on a topic of the workshop,
      to gather feedback from the community. Those papers will be distributed to the audience of the workshop only.</li>
    <li><span class="label label-default">Presentation papers</span> describing a work on a topic of the workshop published recently
      to another conference, but that the community may have missed. Those papers will only be evaluated on their relevance
      to the workshop, and will not be distributed to the audience (a link to the original paper will be given).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<p>Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the programme committee.</p>
        <p>The papers must be submitted electronically through <a
            href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pocr17">EasyChair</a>
        as a PDF file using the <a href="http://www.easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip">EasyChair proceedings style</a>. Each submission is limited to 14 pages, plus references.
        </p>
	<p>Authors should provide enough information and/or data for reviewers to confirm any performance claims. This includes links
	  to a runnable system, access to benchmarks, reference to a public performance results, etc.</p>
