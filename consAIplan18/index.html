    <h2>Purpose</h2>

For this first one-day workshop on the topic of Constraints and AI Planning we take a broad view stemming from the observation that there are fundamental differences in representing and reasoning about a problem via constraints, as is common in CP and optimization, and doing so in the form of a state-transition system, as is common in AI planning, heuristic search, and dynamic programming.

Therefore we hope to attract presentations and discussions on the interactions, overlaps, and differences among CP, SAT, mixed integer programming, AI planning in its many forms (e.g., classical, numeric, temporal, stochastic), heuristic search (i.e., A*-style state-based search) and dynamic programming. We are particularly interested in combinations of two or more perspectives.

This workshop should interest researchers from academia and industry in the areas of constraint programming, operations research, and AI planning. 

      <h2>Background</h2>

While there has been a history of more than 20 years in the application of SAT, CP, and MIP to AI planning problems, there has been recent interest in a deeper cross-fertilization between the areas of constraint programming, operations research, and planning: 
<ul>
<li> A number of papers over the past five years at ICAPS (including at least two best paper winners) and planning sessions of AAAI and IJCAI (again, including at least one best paper winner) have focused on the use of techniques coming from Constraint Programming and Operations Research (e.g., LP, MIP, Logic-based Benders Decomposition) for important components of mainstream solutions to AI planning problems;</li>
<li> A Dagstuhl seminar on AI planning and Operations Research (including in particular several members of the CP community) was held in February 2018;</li>
<li> The 2018 editions of the ICAPS and CPAIOR international conferences are co-located.</li>
</ul>

      <h1 id="topics">Topics</h1>
      <p>Main areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:</p>
      <ul>
<li> Using constraint-based techniques (e.g., CP, SAT, SMT, MIP) for solving AI planning problems including contributing to components of the AI planning solution such as heuristic evaluation.</li>
<li> Theoretical/formal work comparing constraint-based and state-based representation and reasoning.</li>
<li> Empirical studies comparing constraint-based and state-based solution approaches on common classes of problems.</li>
<li> Extending approaches primarily developed in one area to the other (e.g., Lagrangian relaxation, Logic-based Benders decomposition, A*-style search, abstraction).</li>
<li> Understanding and comparing techniques that have been developed and applied independently in both optimization/OR and AI literatures (e.g. multi-valued decision diagrams, dynamic programming vs. heuristic search, Markov Decision Processes).</li>
	</ul>
      <h1 id="programme">Programme/Venue</h1>

Since some of the regular CP conference attendees may not be familiar with AI planning, the workshop starts with a tutorial on its fundamentals.
The rest of the programme includes two invited speakers and several informal presentations and discussions based on the submitted abstracts and on the participants' interests, in keeping with the spirit of Dagstuhl seminars.

<!--
        <p>The workshop will take place at the <a href="http://sat2017.gitlab.io/venue.html">Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre</a>, in Room 107. See the <a href="http://sat2017.gitlab.io/booklet_a5.pdf"> conference booklet</a> for details to locate the room.</p>

        <p>All technical presentations have a 30 minute slot including questions. Invited talks have a 45 minute slot including questions.</p>
